To\n\noptimize performance and comply with local data regulations, iLab is hosted on six different\n\nservers or instances. This regional server configuration ensures a more efficient and reliable user\n\nexperience. Regional Login Links Using the iLab Access Guide Widget Regional Login Links\n\nUnited States: my.ilab.agilent.com Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI): dfci.ilab.agilent.com\n\nStanford University: stanford.ilabsolutions.com Important: If you already have an account on\n\nmy.ilab.agilent.com, you will need to create a separate account for the DFCI or Stanford\n\ninstances to access their platforms. Similarly, users with DFCI or Stanford accounts cannot use\n\nthose credentials on my.ilab.agilent.com and will need to create an account for other U.S.-based\n\nlocations. Canada: ca.ilab.agilent.com Europe: eu.ilab.agilent.com Asia-Pacific:\n\nau.ilab.agilent.com Using the iLab Access Guide Widget If you are unsure which link to use, the\n\niLab Access Guide Widget is available to assist you. This tool guides users to the correct iLab\n\nlanding page based on their institution's requirements. Simply follow the predefined questions,</source>\n\n<source id=\"5\">system. If this is the case, you will have been provided with an\n\ninstitution-specific link (for example institution.ilabsolutions.com, institution.corefacilities.org, or\n\ninstitution.ilab.agilent.com.) You can also check here if your Institution has ID integration with iLab\n\nor if you will need iLab credentials to log in. Note If you intend to visit a core at an institution other\n\nthan your own, you should still log in using your own institution's login link. See the instructions\n\nbelow. With an institution login, you will typically be presented with a screen similar to the one\n\nbelow: Click on the \"here\" link in the top box to be sent to your institution's authentication page.\n\nFrom here, authenticate with your institution credentials, after which you will be redirected to your\n\ndestination in iLab. If accessing a Core facility at an Institution other than your own, and your\n\ninstitution is utilizing the SSO login authentication, click on sign in using other institution\n\ncredentials, search for and select your Institution from the drop-down list, and press Go . You will\n\nthen be redirected to your institution's login page and once logged in, you can access the needed\n\ncore by following the steps outlined here , if you have not landed onto the core page that was\n\nneeded. iLab Login If your institution does not have an ID Integration with iLab, you will use\n\niLab-provided credentials (username and password). Simply complete the Username (first field)\n\nand Password and click \"Sign In\" to access iLab. For reference, some common iLab login pages\n\nare: https://my.ilab.agilent.com (U.S.A.) https://eu.ilab.agilent.com (most of Europe)\n\nhttps://au.ilab.agilent.com (Australia) https://ca.ilab.agilent.com (Canada) Please Contact Support\n\nif you have any issues logging into iLab.

  "llm_summary": "[RAG3] 1. **Analysis of Parameter Differences:**\n\n   - **Temperature**: Batch 1 had a temperature setting of 0.1, which typically results in more deterministic and less creative responses. Batch 2 had a higher temperature of 0.7, leading to more diverse and creative outputs.\n   - **Top P**: Both batches used a Top P value of 1.0, meaning no filtering based on cumulative probability was applied.\n   - **Max Tokens**: Both batches were limited to 90 tokens per response.\n   - **Number of Runs**: Each batch generated two responses.\n\n   The lower temperature in Batch 1 resulted in more focused and concise information about iLab's purpose and users, with specific mention of features like signup and login assistance. In contrast, the higher temperature in Batch 2 produced slightly more varied descriptions but lacked some detail due to the same token limit.\n\n2. **Which Parameter Settings Worked Better for This Query and Why:**\n\n   For this particular query about what iLab is, the settings from Batch 1 (Temperature: 0.1) worked better because they provided a clearer and more structured response with specific details about iLab's purpose, users, and features without unnecessary variability.\n\n3. **Recommendations for Optimal Parameters for Similar Queries:**\n\n   - **Temperature**: A lower temperature (around 0.2-0.3) is recommended for factual queries where concise and accurate information is required.\n   - **Top P**: Keeping Top P at around 0.9-1.0 ensures that all relevant possibilities are considered without overly restricting the output.\n   - **Max Tokens**: Depending on the complexity of the query, adjusting Max Tokens between 100-150 can provide sufficient space for detailed responses while avoiding truncation.\n   \nBy using these parameters, you can achieve a balance between creativity and accuracy suitable for informative queries similar to this one about iLab.\n\nFor reference:\niLab is an operations software designed to streamline management tasks such as scheduling, billing, and reporting within core facilities at research institutions [1][2]."
