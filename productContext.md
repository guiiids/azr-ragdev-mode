# Product Context: Azure Search RAG Assistant

## Purpose
The Azure Search RAG Assistant exists to provide users with accurate, contextually relevant information by leveraging a knowledge base through retrieval-augmented generation. It bridges the gap between traditional search engines and AI assistants by combining the strengths of both approaches.

## Problems Solved
1. **Knowledge Accuracy**: By grounding responses in a curated knowledge base, the system reduces hallucinations and provides more factual answers than pure generative AI.
2. **Information Transparency**: Through citation management, users can trace the sources of information, increasing trust and verifiability.
3. **Contextual Understanding**: The system understands user queries in context and provides relevant information rather than just keyword matching.
4. **Developer Evaluation**: The developer mode allows for testing and improving the system's responses, ensuring continuous quality improvement.
5. **Customization**: Users can adjust system prompts and model parameters to tailor the assistant's behavior to specific needs.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Interface**: A clean, responsive chat interface that feels natural and familiar to users.
2. **Transparent Responses**: Clear indication of sources through citations, with the ability to view source details.
3. **Responsive Interaction**: Streaming responses provide immediate feedback and a more conversational feel.
4. **Customizable Behavior**: Settings drawer allows users to adjust how the assistant responds.
5. **Developer Tools**: Special mode for developers to evaluate and improve system performance.

## Target Users
1. **End Users**: People seeking information from the knowledge base in a conversational manner.
2. **Content Managers**: Those responsible for maintaining and improving the knowledge base.
3. **Developers**: Technical users who need to evaluate and improve the system's performance.
4. **System Administrators**: Those who configure and maintain the application.

## Integration Context
The system integrates with:
1. **Azure OpenAI**: For generating contextually relevant responses.
2. **Azure Search**: For retrieving relevant information from the knowledge base.
3. **Existing Knowledge Bases**: The system can connect to various document repositories through Azure Search.

## Success Metrics
1. **Response Accuracy**: How factually correct the responses are.
2. **Relevance**: How well the responses address the user's query.
3. **User Satisfaction**: Measured through feedback mechanisms.
4. **System Performance**: Response time and resource utilization.
5. **Developer Productivity**: How effectively developers can evaluate and improve the system.
