## Query
```
WHAT IS ILAB?
```

## Parameters
- **Temperature:** N/A
- **Top P:** N/A
- **Max Tokens:** N/A

## Custom Prompt
```
Batch 1: 
Batch 2: 
```

## LLM Output
```
BATCH 1 (first run):
[RAG3] iLab is a software platform designed to support the management of core facilities and shared resources in research institutions. It helps users with various tasks such as creating accounts, managing lab memberships, scheduling equipment usage, and handling billing information. iLab is used globally and hosted on multiple regional servers to ensure efficient performance and compliance with local data regulations [1], [2].

BATCH 2 (first run):
[RAG3] iLab is a software platform used by research institutions and core facilities to manage laboratory operations, including scheduling equipment, billing, and user management. It supports various functionalities such as creating accounts, managing lab memberships, and accessing core facilities. iLab is hosted on multiple regional servers to optimize performance and comply with local data regulations [1]. Users can register for an account using specific links provided by their institution or through generic sign-up forms based on their location [2].
```

## Developer Evaluation
[RAG3] - **Improving the prompt for clarity, specificity, or effectiveness:**
  - Clearly define the purpose of each batch in the prompt.
  - Specify exact parameters to avoid ambiguity (e.g., temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, max_tokens=150).
  - Include a brief description of iLab directly in the prompt to provide context.

- **Adjusting parameters for optimal results:**
  - Set `temperature` to a moderate value (e.g., 0.7) to balance creativity and coherence.
  - Use `top_p` around 0.9 to ensure diverse yet relevant outputs.
  - Define `max_tokens` based on desired response length (e.g., max_tokens=150).

- **Identifying any issues or gaps in the source data:**
  - Ensure all sources are correctly cited and relevant information is extracted.
  - Verify that descriptions from sources are comprehensive and up-to-date.

- **Recommending further experiments or next steps:**
  - Test different combinations of parameters to find optimal settings for clarity and relevance.
  - Experiment with additional prompts focusing on specific aspects of iLab (e.g., user management, billing).
  - Validate responses against user feedback to refine prompts further.

**Example Improved Prompt:**

Batch 1:
```
Query: WHAT IS ILAB?
Prompt: Provide a detailed overview of iLab software platform including its functionalities, regional hosting details, and user registration process. 
Parameters: temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, max_tokens=150
```

Batch 2:
```
Query: WHAT IS ILAB?
Prompt: Explain how iLab supports core facilities and shared resources management in research institutions globally. Include specifics about account creation and regional server hosting.
Parameters: temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, max_tokens=150
```
## LLM Analysis

[RAG3] 1. **Analysis of how the parameter differences affected the outputs:**

In this case, both batches used identical parameters (Default prompt, Temperature: 0.3, Top P: 1, Max Tokens: 1000, Number of runs: 1). Therefore, the differences in the responses are not due to variations in these settings but rather due to inherent variability in the model's output generation.

2. **Which parameter settings worked better for this query and why:**

Since both batches used identical settings and produced similar quality responses that accurately describe iLab and its functionalities with appropriate citations [1], [2], neither set of parameters can be deemed superior based on this comparison alone.

3. **Recommendations for optimal parameters for similar queries:**

Given that both sets of parameters yielded satisfactory results:

- **Temperature:** Keeping it at 0.3 is effective as it ensures a balance between creativity and coherence.
- **Top P:** Setting it to 1 allows for considering all possible tokens which helps maintain comprehensive answers.
- **Max Tokens:** A limit of 1000 tokens provides ample space for detailed responses without truncation.
- **Number of runs:** Running multiple iterations (e.g., more than one) could help identify the most accurate or informative response if there is variability.

For similar queries:
- Maintain temperature at around 0.3 to ensure coherent yet sufficiently varied responses.
- Keep Top P at 1 to allow full token consideration.
- Ensure max tokens are sufficient (e.g., around 1000) to capture detailed information.
- Consider increasing the number of runs beyond one to select from multiple generated responses for optimal accuracy and completeness.

These recommendations should help achieve consistent and high-quality outputs for queries about software platforms like iLab.
