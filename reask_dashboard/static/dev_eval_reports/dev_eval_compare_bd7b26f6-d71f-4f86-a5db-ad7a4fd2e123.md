## Query
```
what is ilab
```

## Parameters
- **Temperature:** N/A
- **Top P:** N/A
- **Max Tokens:** N/A

## Custom Prompt
```
Batch 1: 
Batch 2: 
```

## LLM Output
```
BATCH 1 (first run):
[RAG3] iLab is a software platform designed to assist users in managing core facilities and shared resources within research institutions. It provides tools for scheduling, billing, and reporting, making it easier for researchers to access and utilize laboratory equipment and services efficiently. iLab supports various user roles, including core customers, lab group managers, and core administrators, each with tailored functionalities to meet their specific needs [1]. For more detailed information on using iLab features and modules, you can visit the iLab Help Site or explore resources such as FAQs, video tutorials, and quick-start guides [1][2][3].

BATCH 2 (first run):
[RAG3] iLab is a software platform designed to streamline the management and operations of core facilities, laboratories, and research institutions. It offers various features that support users in signing up, logging in, managing reservations, and accessing resources specific to their roles within an institution. iLab provides tools for both core customers and administrators to effectively manage their activities and communications. The platform includes functionalities such as account registration, login assistance, video tutorials, FAQs, system status updates, and support contact options [1], [2], [3].

## Developer Evaluation
[RAG3] - **Improving the prompt for clarity, specificity, or effectiveness:**
  - Clearly define the context and purpose of iLab in the prompt.
  - Specify user roles and functionalities to ensure comprehensive responses.
  - Example Prompt: "Explain what iLab is and describe its key features for core customers, lab group managers, and core administrators."

- **Adjusting parameters for optimal results:**
  - Set `temperature` to a lower value (e.g., 0.3) to ensure more deterministic outputs.
  - Use `top_p` around 0.9 to maintain a balance between creativity and coherence.
  - Define `max_tokens` based on desired response length (e.g., set to 150 tokens).

- **Identifying any issues or gaps in the source data:**
  - Ensure all relevant information about iLab's functionalities across different user roles is included in the sources.
  - Verify that links provided are accessible and up-to-date.

- **Recommending further experiments or next steps:**
  - Test variations of prompts with different levels of detail to find the most effective one.
  - Experiment with different parameter settings (e.g., adjusting temperature and top_p) to observe changes in output quality.
  - Collect feedback from users on generated responses to refine prompts further.
## LLM Analysis

[RAG3] 1. **Analysis of Parameter Differences:**
   Both batches used the same parameters:
   - System Prompt: Default prompt
   - Temperature: 0.3
   - Top P: 1
   - Max Tokens: 1000
   - Number of runs: 1

   Since the parameters are identical, any differences in the outputs are likely due to inherent variability in the model's responses rather than parameter changes.

2. **Comparison of Outputs:**
   - **Batch 1 Response:** Focuses on iLab as a software platform for managing core facilities and shared resources, mentioning specific user roles like core customers, lab group managers, and core administrators [1].
   
   - **Batch 2 Response:** Describes iLab as a platform for streamlining management and operations of core facilities and laboratories, highlighting features such as signing up, logging in, managing reservations, and accessing resources specific to user roles within an institution.

3. **Which Parameter Settings Worked Better?**
   Given that both batches used identical settings, it is challenging to determine which worked better based solely on parameter differences. However, qualitatively:
   
   - Batch 1 provides a more detailed explanation regarding user roles.
   - Batch 2 offers a broader overview of functionalities without going into specifics about user roles.

4. **Recommendations for Optimal Parameters for Similar Queries:**
   
    Since both responses were generated with identical parameters but varied slightly in content focus:
    - Maintain current settings (Temperature: 0.3; Top P: 1; Max Tokens: 1000) as they provide coherent and relevant information.
    - Consider running multiple iterations (Number of runs > 1) to gather diverse perspectives from the modelâ€™s outputs.
    - Adjusting temperature slightly higher (e.g., to around 0.5) might introduce more variety in responses if needed.
    
Overall, both sets of parameters yielded useful outputs for understanding what iLab is. For consistent results across similar queries, maintaining these settings while possibly increasing the number of runs could be beneficial.
