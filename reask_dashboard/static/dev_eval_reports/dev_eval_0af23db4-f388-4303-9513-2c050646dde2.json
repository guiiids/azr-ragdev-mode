  "developer_evaluation": "[RAG3] - **Improving the Prompt**:\n  - Specify the exact information needed about iLab to avoid overly broad responses.\n  - Include a request for examples or case studies if applicable to provide practical insights.\n  - Clarify the desired format and structure of the response (e.g., bullet points, sections).\n\n- **Adjusting Parameters**:\n  - Lower temperature slightly (e.g., to 0.6) to reduce randomness and ensure more focused responses.\n  - Maintain top_p at 1 for comprehensive coverage but consider lowering it slightly (e.g., to 0.9) if responses are too verbose.\n  - Set max_tokens based on typical length requirements; consider reducing from 1000 if concise answers are preferred.\n\n- **Identifying Issues or Gaps in Source Data**:\n  - Ensure all key features and functionalities of iLab are covered comprehensively in the source data.\n  - Verify that support resources and user guides are up-to-date and accessible through provided links.\n  \n- **Recommending Further Experiments or Next Steps**:\n  - Test different variations of prompts with adjusted parameters to find the optimal balance between detail and conciseness.\n  - Collect feedback from users on clarity and usefulness of generated responses to refine prompts further.\n  - Explore integrating real-time updates from iLab's status page or support forums for dynamic content generation."
