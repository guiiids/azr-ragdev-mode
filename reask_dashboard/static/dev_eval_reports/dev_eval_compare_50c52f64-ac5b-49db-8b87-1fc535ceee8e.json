  "developer_evaluation": "[RAG3] - **Improving the prompt for clarity, specificity, or effectiveness:**\n  - Clearly define the purpose of each batch in the prompt.\n  - Specify exact parameters to avoid ambiguity (e.g., temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, max_tokens=150).\n  - Include a brief description of iLab directly in the prompt to provide context.\n\n- **Adjusting parameters for optimal results:**\n  - Set `temperature` to a moderate value (e.g., 0.7) to balance creativity and coherence.\n  - Use `top_p` around 0.9 to ensure diverse yet relevant outputs.\n  - Define `max_tokens` based on desired response length (e.g., max_tokens=150).\n\n- **Identifying any issues or gaps in the source data:**\n  - Ensure all sources are correctly cited and relevant information is extracted.\n  - Verify that descriptions from sources are comprehensive and up-to-date.\n\n- **Recommending further experiments or next steps:**\n  - Test different combinations of parameters to find optimal settings for clarity and relevance.\n  - Experiment with additional prompts focusing on specific aspects of iLab (e.g., user management, billing).\n  - Validate responses against user feedback to refine prompts further.\n\n**Example Improved Prompt:**\n\nBatch 1:\n```\nQuery: WHAT IS ILAB?\nPrompt: Provide a detailed overview of iLab software platform including its functionalities, regional hosting details, and user registration process. \nParameters: temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, max_tokens=150\n```\n\nBatch 2:\n```\nQuery: WHAT IS ILAB?\nPrompt: Explain how iLab supports core facilities and shared resources management in research institutions globally. Include specifics about account creation and regional server hosting.\nParameters: temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, max_tokens=150\n```",
  "llm_analysis": "[RAG3] 1. **Analysis of how the parameter differences affected the outputs:**\n\nIn this case, both batches used identical parameters (Default prompt, Temperature: 0.3, Top P: 1, Max Tokens: 1000, Number of runs: 1). Therefore, the differences in the responses are not due to variations in these settings but rather due to inherent variability in the model's output generation.\n\n2. **Which parameter settings worked better for this query and why:**\n\nSince both batches used identical settings and produced similar quality responses that accurately describe iLab and its functionalities with appropriate citations [1], [2], neither set of parameters can be deemed superior based on this comparison alone.\n\n3. **Recommendations for optimal parameters for similar queries:**\n\nGiven that both sets of parameters yielded satisfactory results:\n\n- **Temperature:** Keeping it at 0.3 is effective as it ensures a balance between creativity and coherence.\n- **Top P:** Setting it to 1 allows for considering all possible tokens which helps maintain comprehensive answers.\n- **Max Tokens:** A limit of 1000 tokens provides ample space for detailed responses without truncation.\n- **Number of runs:** Running multiple iterations (e.g., more than one) could help identify the most accurate or informative response if there is variability.\n\nFor similar queries:\n- Maintain temperature at around 0.3 to ensure coherent yet sufficiently varied responses.\n- Keep Top P at 1 to allow full token consideration.\n- Ensure max tokens are sufficient (e.g., around 1000) to capture detailed information.\n- Consider increasing the number of runs beyond one to select from multiple generated responses for optimal accuracy and completeness.\n\nThese recommendations should help achieve consistent and high-quality outputs for queries about software platforms like iLab."
