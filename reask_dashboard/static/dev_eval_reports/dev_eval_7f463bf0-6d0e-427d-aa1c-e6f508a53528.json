  "developer_evaluation": "[RAG3] - **Improving the Prompt:**\n  - Specify the exact Lab Management System being used (e.g., iLab).\n  - Include a brief introduction explaining the context or purpose of removing a member.\n  - Ensure each step is clear and concise, avoiding any ambiguous terms.\n\n- **Adjusting Parameters for Optimal Results:**\n  - **Temperature:** Keep at 0.2 for focused and deterministic responses.\n  - **Top_p:** Maintain at 1 to consider all possible tokens and ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  - **Max_tokens:** Set to around 500 to keep responses detailed but concise.\n\n- **Identifying Issues or Gaps in the Source Data:**\n  - Ensure that all steps are aligned with the specific functionalities of the system mentioned (e.g., iLab).\n  - Verify that there are no missing steps or unclear instructions in the provided guide.\n\n- **Recommending Further Experiments or Next Steps:**\n  - Test the prompt with different variations of user queries to ensure robustness.\n  - Experiment with slightly higher temperatures (e.g., up to 0.4) if more creative solutions are needed.\n  - Collect feedback from actual users on clarity and usability, then iterate on prompt improvements based on this feedback.\n\nBy following these suggestions, developers can enhance clarity, specificity, and overall effectiveness of prompts for removing members from lab management systems like iLab [1]."
