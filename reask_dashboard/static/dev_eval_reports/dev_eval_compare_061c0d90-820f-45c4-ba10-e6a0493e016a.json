  "developer_evaluation": "[RAG3] - **Improving the Prompt:**\n  - Clearly define the context and expected output for each batch.\n  - Specify the language or tone if needed (e.g., formal, casual).\n  - Include examples of desired responses to guide the model.\n\n- **Adjusting Parameters:**\n  - Set `temperature` to a value between 0.7 and 0.9 for balanced creativity and coherence.\n  - Use `top_p` around 0.85 to ensure diverse yet relevant outputs.\n  - Define `max_tokens` based on typical response length, e.g., set it to around 50-100 tokens.\n\n- **Identifying Issues/Gaps in Source Data:**\n  - Ensure source data includes varied examples of user queries and desired responses.\n  - Verify that source data covers multiple scenarios and contexts for comprehensive training.\n\n- **Recommending Further Experiments/Next Steps:**\n  - Conduct A/B testing with different prompt structures and parameter settings.\n  - Analyze user feedback to refine prompts further.\n  - Experiment with including additional contextual information in prompts to improve specificity.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, developers can enhance clarity, optimize parameters, address gaps in source data, and plan effective next steps for improving system performance.",
  "llm_analysis": "[RAG3] 1. Analysis of how the parameter differences affected the outputs:\n   - **System Prompt**: The main difference between Batch 1 and Batch 2 is the system prompt. In Batch 1, it is set to \"\\\", which might be an incomplete or non-standard prompt, while in Batch 2, it uses a \"Default prompt\". This difference likely influenced the language used in the responses.\n   - **Temperature and Top P**: Both batches have identical settings for Temperature (0.3) and Top P (1), meaning they both aim for less randomness and more deterministic outputs.\n   - **Max Tokens and Number of Runs**: These parameters are also identical across both batches, ensuring that each response has a maximum length of 1000 tokens and only one run per batch.\n\n2. Which parameter settings worked better for this query and why:\n   - Based on the sample responses provided, Batch 2's settings seem to work better as it produced a greeting in Spanish (\"Hola, ¿cómo puedo ayudarte hoy?\"), which might be more appropriate depending on the user's context or preferred language. The use of a default system prompt likely contributed to generating a more contextually relevant response.\n\n3. Recommendations for optimal parameters for similar queries:\n   - **System Prompt**: Use a well-defined or default system prompt to ensure clarity and relevance in responses.\n   - **Temperature**: A setting of 0.3 is generally good for reducing randomness while maintaining some variability in responses.\n   - **Top P**: Keeping this at 1 ensures that all possible completions are considered but still prioritizes higher probability completions.\n   - **Max Tokens**: Adjust based on expected response length; 1000 tokens should suffice for most queries but can be reduced if shorter responses are desired.\n   - **Number of Runs**: One run is typically sufficient unless multiple variations are needed.\n\nFor similar queries where user interaction involves greetings or simple assistance requests, using clear prompts with low temperature settings will help maintain consistency and relevance in generated responses."
