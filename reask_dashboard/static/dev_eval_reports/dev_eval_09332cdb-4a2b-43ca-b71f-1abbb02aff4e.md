## Query
```
Describe the specific features within Agilent OpenLab CDS 2.x that support FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance for data integrity
```

## Parameters
- **Temperature:** 0.5
- **Top P:** 1
- **Max Tokens:** 1500

## LLM Output
```
[RAG3] Agilent OpenLab CDS 2.x includes several specific features designed to support FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance for data integrity. These features ensure that electronic records are attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and maintained with integrity. Key functionalities include:

1. **Mandatory Login**: Ensures that only authorized users can access the system.
2. **Security Policies**: Includes configurable session locking to prevent unauthorized access when the system is unattended.
3. **Configurable User Roles and Privileges**: Allows precise control over who can perform specific actions within the system.
4. **Full Data Traceability through Audit Trails**: Tracks all changes made to data, providing a complete history of modifications.
5. **Full Result Data Versioning**: Maintains all versions of data results to ensure traceability.
6. **Electronic Signatures and Configurable Signature Order**: Supports electronic signatures that are compliant with regulatory requirements and allows configuration of signature workflows [1], [2].

These features collectively help organizations using OpenLab CDS maintain compliance with 21 CFR Part 11 by ensuring robust security measures and comprehensive documentation of data handling processes.

## Developer Evaluation
[RAG3] - **Improving the Prompt for Clarity, Specificity, or Effectiveness:**
  - Clearly specify the version of OpenLab CDS (e.g., "OpenLab CDS version 2.x").
  - Include a brief explanation of why FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance is important.
  - Ask for examples or scenarios where these features are applied in practice.

- **Adjusting Parameters for Optimal Results:**
  - Lower the temperature to around 0.3 to reduce randomness and ensure more focused responses.
  - Set `top_p` to around 0.9 to narrow down the range of possible outputs while still allowing some diversity.
  
- **Identifying Any Issues or Gaps in the Source Data:**
  - Ensure that all relevant features and their descriptions are included in the source data.
  - Verify that there are no missing functionalities related to FDA compliance mentioned elsewhere in documentation but not covered here.

- **Recommending Further Experiments or Next Steps:**
  - Conduct tests with different parameter settings (e.g., varying temperature and top_p) to find the optimal balance between creativity and accuracy.
  - Experiment with prompts that ask for step-by-step explanations or real-world applications of each feature.
  - Gather user feedback on generated responses to refine prompt structure and parameter settings further.
