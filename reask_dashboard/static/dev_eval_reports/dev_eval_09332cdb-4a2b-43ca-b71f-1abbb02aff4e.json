      "content": "White Paper\n\nOverview\nUS FDA Part 11 in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and its EU \nanalog, Eudralex Chapter 4, Annex 11, describe the requirements for electronic \nrecords and electronic signatures for regulated pharmaceutical organizations. \nReleased in 1997, 21 CFR Part 11 has been enforced since 1999. The intent \nof these guidelines is to ensure that all appropriate electronic records are \nattributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and maintained with \nintegrity.\n\nThis white paper is a resource for users of Agilent OpenLab CDS systems whose \norganizations must comply with these regulations. OpenLab CDS controls \nacquisition and processing of LC, GC, single-quadrupole LC/MS and GC/MS, and \nA/D data. It is the responsibility of the user and their organization to ensure that \nthe functionalities provided by OpenLab CDS are used appropriately to achieve \ncompliant operation for laboratory data acquisition and processing. In addition \nto the technical controls OpenLab CDS provides, the user organization must \nestablish procedural controls–standard operating procedures (SOPs)– to address \nrelevant non-technical requirements. For example, controls such as internal audit \nprograms, must also be established to ensure that system operators follow the \nSOPs.\n\nAppendix 1 provides a detailed description of how OpenLab CDS supports users \nand their organizations in achieving the requirements of each section of 21 CFR \nPart 11 and the related sections of EU Annex 11. The descriptions assume that \nsystem access, including instrument hardware and software, is controlled by the \nstaff responsible for the electronic records contained on the system. Thus, the \nsystem is designed as a “closed system” as defined in 21 CFR Part 11.3(b)(4).\n\nSupport for Title 21 CFR Part 11 and \nAnnex 11 compliance:  \nAgilent OpenLab CDS\nValid for OpenLab CDS version 2.7\n\n\n\n2\n\n21 CFR Part 11\n21 CFR Part 11 covers three specific"

Introduction \nOpenLab CDS is developed according to the quality process and software lifecycle \nfollowed by the Life Science and Chemical Analysis divisions of Agilent Technologies. \nIt has a number of features specifically to help users document that their analyses \nmeet current regulations and quality standards including, but not limited to the Food \nand Drug Administration's (FDA) 21 CFR Part 210 (Current Good Manufacturing \nPractice In Manufacturing, Processing, Packing, Or Holding Of Drugs), 21 CFR Part \n211 (Current Good Manufacturing Practice For Finished Pharmaceuticals), 21 CFR \nPart 58 (Good Laboratory Practice For Nonclinical Laboratory Studies). These \nfeatures help users validate and specify methods, verify that methods are fit for their \nintended use, verify system performance and operation, and ensure the traceability, \nintegrity and security of the data. \n\nOpenLab CDS provides the following software functionalities which enable \ncompliance with of 21 CFR Part 11 and similar rules: \n Mandatory login  \n Security policies including configurable session locking \n Configurable user roles and privileges \n Full data traceability through audit trails \n Full result data versioning \n Electronic signatures and configurable signature order \n\nFor those specifically concerned with 21 CFR Part 11 or the European Medicine \nAgency's (EMA) Good manufacturing practice (GMP) Guidelines - Annex 11 \n(Computerized Systems) compliance please consult the white paper Support for Title \n21 CFR Part 11 and Annex 11 compliance: Agilent OpenLab CDS available from Agilent"

  "developer_evaluation": "[RAG3] - **Improving the Prompt for Clarity, Specificity, or Effectiveness:**\n  - Clearly specify the version of OpenLab CDS (e.g., \"OpenLab CDS version 2.x\").\n  - Include a brief explanation of why FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance is important.\n  - Ask for examples or scenarios where these features are applied in practice.\n\n- **Adjusting Parameters for Optimal Results:**\n  - Lower the temperature to around 0.3 to reduce randomness and ensure more focused responses.\n  - Set `top_p` to around 0.9 to narrow down the range of possible outputs while still allowing some diversity.\n  \n- **Identifying Any Issues or Gaps in the Source Data:**\n  - Ensure that all relevant features and their descriptions are included in the source data.\n  - Verify that there are no missing functionalities related to FDA compliance mentioned elsewhere in documentation but not covered here.\n\n- **Recommending Further Experiments or Next Steps:**\n  - Conduct tests with different parameter settings (e.g., varying temperature and top_p) to find the optimal balance between creativity and accuracy.\n  - Experiment with prompts that ask for step-by-step explanations or real-world applications of each feature.\n  - Gather user feedback on generated responses to refine prompt structure and parameter settings further."
