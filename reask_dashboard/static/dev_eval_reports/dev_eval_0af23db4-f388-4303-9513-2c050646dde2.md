## Developer Evaluation
[RAG3] - **Improving the Prompt**:
  - Specify the exact information needed about iLab to avoid overly broad responses.
  - Include a request for examples or case studies if applicable to provide practical insights.
  - Clarify the desired format and structure of the response (e.g., bullet points, sections).

- **Adjusting Parameters**:
  - Lower temperature slightly (e.g., to 0.6) to reduce randomness and ensure more focused responses.
  - Maintain top_p at 1 for comprehensive coverage but consider lowering it slightly (e.g., to 0.9) if responses are too verbose.
  - Set max_tokens based on typical length requirements; consider reducing from 1000 if concise answers are preferred.

- **Identifying Issues or Gaps in Source Data**:
  - Ensure all key features and functionalities of iLab are covered comprehensively in the source data.
  - Verify that support resources and user guides are up-to-date and accessible through provided links.
  
- **Recommending Further Experiments or Next Steps**:
