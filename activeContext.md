# Active Context: Azure Search RAG Assistant

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on implementing and refining the Developer Evaluation Chat UI functionality. This feature allows developers to test and evaluate the RAG system's responses with different parameters and prompts.

## Recent Changes
1. Created a JavaScript module for Developer Evaluation Chat UI (`static/js/dev_eval_chat.js`)
2. Updated the Flask application to include the new JavaScript file
3. Implemented state management for the conversation flow in Developer Mode
4. Added parameter collection steps and validation for user inputs
5. Implemented parameter saving and loading functionality
6. Added clear messaging for each parameter collection step
7. Implemented error handling for invalid inputs

## Next Steps
1. Test the conversational flow in Developer Mode
2. Verify parameter persistence in localStorage
3. Ensure proper integration with the settings drawer
4. Test mobile responsiveness
5. Verify that the developer mode toggle works correctly
6. Test the "View in Console" functionality
7. Conduct comprehensive testing with various queries and parameters
8. Verify that parameters are correctly passed to the API
9. Check that results are properly displayed
10. Ensure that the conversation can be reset and restarted

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **Parameter Persistence**: Using localStorage to maintain parameter settings between sessions
2. **UI Integration**: Ensuring the Developer Mode integrates seamlessly with the existing chat interface
3. **Conversation Flow**: Designing a step-by-step flow for collecting evaluation parameters
4. **Error Handling**: Implementing robust validation and error handling for user inputs
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the evaluation process doesn't impact the overall application performance

## Important Patterns and Preferences
1. **Code Organization**: Keeping the Developer Evaluation functionality in a separate JavaScript module
2. **State Management**: Using a state machine pattern for managing the conversation flow
3. **UI Consistency**: Maintaining consistent styling with the main application
4. **Error Feedback**: Providing immediate and clear feedback for invalid inputs
5. **Documentation**: Maintaining comprehensive documentation of the implementation

## Learnings and Project Insights
1. **Streaming Responses**: The streaming response pattern provides a more responsive user experience
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Different model parameters significantly affect response quality and style
3. **Citation Management**: Proper citation management is crucial for transparency and trust
4. **User Feedback**: Collecting and analyzing user feedback helps improve the system
5. **Developer Experience**: A dedicated developer mode streamlines the testing and evaluation process
